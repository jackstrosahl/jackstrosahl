I am a Full Stack Software Engineer at DataChat Inc., where I use Python, JavaScript, Go, React.js, Redux, HTML, CSS, and SQL.  I have been full-time here since December 2021, and was an intern here for over 2 years.

Before DataChat, I interned as a Software Developer at Inflection Point Solutions, using C#, JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, and SQL.  I was in that position for over 1 year.

In my hobbies and undergrad, I have also used Java, C, C++, R, GDScript, GLSL, Linux, Git, and Docker.

My programming hobbies include game development, game server hosting, and generative art.  I mainly use the Godot Game engine for my games, which has its own language, GDScript.  Hosting game servers for many years, I've learned a lot Linux system administration.  For generative art, I mainly use P5.JS, a JavaScript library for that purpose.

I have a B.S in Computer Science from UW Madison, along with certificates (minors) in Game Design and Art.

Outside of programming, I enjoy biking and rock climbing.
